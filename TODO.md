## Build system

Have updated the build system, but it seems a later build of macwidgets was used by this code base. Will need to pull and build this code and create a local repo on my machine for maven to grab.

## Code

The mac specific code won't compile on other platforms, should look into how to make the build system work everywhere without exception by replace those Apple specific  JVM libraries.
