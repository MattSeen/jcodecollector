jCodeCollector
==============

jCodeCollector was a simple snippets manager for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux originally developed by Alessandro Cocco in his free time who open source the code in September 2012 (you can read more about him and the original program [at his website][AlessandroWebsite]). I have decided to improve and eventually build upon the foundation he has created.

I forked the repo at its last stable version (2.5) which was released in January 2011.

I intend on initially making some fairly simple changes to the code base to clean up it's current design and behavior, but in future wish to make this into a more robust and potentially extendible application.

The code base is under active development. If you want to check out the code base just do so using Git in the usual manor. There is a [development wiki][WikiAddress] you can check out which I will try to keep up to date with info on running the app and any gotchas I come across. I just wrote a guide on [how to set-up your PC][WikiSetup] to try out the code from source.
