jCodeCollector
==============

jCodeCollector was a simple snippets manager for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux originally developed by Alessandro Cocco in his free time who open source the code in September 2012. I have decided to improve and eventually build upon the foundation he has created.

I forked the repo at it's last stable version (2.5) which was released in January 2011.

I intend on initially making some fairly simple changes to the code base to clean up it's current design and behaviour, but in future wish to make this is to a more robust and potentially extendable application. I see a major amount of potential in it.

## Dependencies

* Apache Derby
* JDom
* MacWidgets
* MRJAdapter
