I have decided to improve and eventually build upon the foundation he has created.\r\n\r\nI forked the repo at it's last stable version (2.5) which was released in January 2011.\r\n\r\nI intend on initially making some fairly simple changes to the code base to clean up it's current design and behaviour, but in future wish to make this is to a more robust and potentially extendable application. I see a major amount of potential in it.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Apache Derby\r\n* JDom\r\n* MacWidgets\r\n* MRJAdapter\r\n* RSyntaxTextArea\r\n* SwingLayout\r\n* JDK 1.5 or greater\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
